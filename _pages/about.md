CARL (Cognitive Applications Reseach Lab) is an independent student-run Research and Development Lab. CARL offers one a platform to enhance and nurture one's research acumen and development abilities.

By bridging the gap between students and academia, we not only make research easily accessible for everyone but also encourage students to write their own papers.
